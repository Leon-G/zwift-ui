	  <h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>
The Zebra environment is a playground that is provided by the ZeroVM
community for the ZeroVM community.  Zebra consists of an OpenStack
Swift deployment with ZeroVM installed providing additional
functionality above and beyond the basic Swift API.</p>

<p>YOU SHOULD NOT STORE ANY DATA IN ZEBRA THAT YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO
LOSE COMPLETELY WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING, AND YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON
ZEBRA FOR ANYTHING THAT EVEN REMOTELY RESEMBLES A PRODUCTION
APPLICATION OR SYSTEM.  This is, after all, why we are calling it a
playground, and not charging you to play.</p>
<h3>Full Disclaimer</h3>
<p>The Zebra playground exists to provide new members of the community
a chance to get their hands on and experiment with the ZeroVM
technology.  It also serves as a testing platform where the community
has a chance to test new features and functionality, at scale, on
physical hardware.  Because Zebra is the communities’ only large scale
testing platform you should expect issues with the playground from
time to time and periodically all data stored in the playground will
be erased.</p>
<p>You should understand that:</p>
<ol />

<li /> Any data you store on Zebra may be lost at any time with no
advanced warning and there will be no way to recover this data.

<li />Zebra will have unplanned and unexpected outages that may last
for hours or even days, during which time the entire playground and
any data you have stored in it will be partially or completely
unavailable.

<li />Zebra will be updated periodically and those updates
may include changes to functionality that may break existing
applications.  While we intend to communicate the updates and any
contract breaking changes ahead of time there may be situations when
these changes are pushed without warning.

<li />The ZeroVM community will provide support for the Zebra
environment on a best effort basis through IRC, and the ZeroVM mailing
list.  This means that you may or may not be able to get immediate
assistance for any problems or issues you encounter.
</ol>
